# MC.JS
MC.JS is a fork of SharpMC (rewritten version for .NET Core). MC.JS provides a JavaScript plugin API. As development of SharpMC ended a while ago, the current supported version of Minecraft is 1.11. Currently, MC.JS expands SharpMC's plugin API for C#, and makes it available to JavaScript. The main focus of MC.JS is the API. However, if you are a C# developer and are interested in updating the software to support modern versions (even if new features aren't supported), that'd be great!
